inf2100-test-script
===================

A python script that automates testing of the compiler made for the UiO course inf2100

Download it into your project root folder and execute the test.py file. It is important that your Cflat.jar file is one directory over.

The script will try to use your Cflat.jar file to compile all the cflat files int the testfiles directory.
If the compiler exits with an error, messages from the compiler will be printed to your console and .log and .s files will be moved to the output folder.

You can also specify the path to a file as an argument to the script.
